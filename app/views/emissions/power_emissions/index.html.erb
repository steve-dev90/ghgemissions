  <p>
    This chart shows how emissions from
    your use of eletricity changes over a twenty four hour day.
    We assume that the amount of electricity that you use varies
    in the same way, more or less, as a typical household in Wellington.
  </p>
  <p>
    Emissions are typically high in the evening and morning. This is
    because most households use more electricity at this time and
    also because this is when the most emission intensive electricity
    if produced.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your daily emissions use will change over the year, being higher
    in the winter and lower in the summer. Over winter most households
    will use a lot more electricity, and it may also be because more
    emission intensive electricity is produced.
