          This chart shows how emissions from
          your eletricity use changes over a twenty four hour day.
          We assume that the amount of electricity that you use varies
          in the same way, more or less, as a typical residential user in Wellington.

          Emissions are typically high in the evening and morning. This is
          because most households use more electricity at this time but
          also because this is when the most emission intensive electricity
          if produced.
