### Understand your carbon footprint

Calculate your greenhouse gas emissions for your household power use, household gas use and car travel.

We use up to date emissions factors and calculators customised for Aotearoa and using our in depth knowledge of the energy sector.

You'll need:
* Your last power bill
* Your last gas bill ... if you use gas
* How much you spent on petrol or diesel for the last week or month

Go on ... every journey starts with a single step.
