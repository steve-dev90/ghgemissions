### About Green Foot Prints
Green Foot Prints is beta site that helps households calculate their greenhouse gas emissions.

### Which Greenhouse Gas Emissions Do We Calculate
We focus on greenhouse gas emissions that households have the most control over.

We currently calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with your household power use, household gas use and car travel. We are always working on expanding this list to provide a more comprehensive picture of your households greenhouse gas emissions.

### How are our Greenhouse Gas Emissions Calculated
Greenhouse gas emissions calculations estimate your emissions using calculators and emission factors specific to Aotearoa.

##### Power
Greenhouse gas emissions from the our electricity system varies throughout the day and throughout the year. Emissions will depend on what power stations are generating electricity at any given time. To take this into account we use information sourced from the Electricity Authority. We calculate an average electricity system greenhouse gas emission factors for each half hour trading period in a day. This calculation is repeated for every month of the year.

We estimate your how much power you use in a given trading period or month using your latest energy bill and a typical household elecricity profile. This profile gives us the typical breakdown of power use by time and is based on information obtained from the Electricity Authority.

##### Gas
Greenhouse gas emissions for your household gas use are estimated using emission factors sourced from the Ministry of Environment.

We estimate your how much power you use in a given month using your latest energy bill and a typical household gas use profile. This profile is based on information obtained from the Gas Industry Company.

##### Car Travel
Greenhouse gas emissions for petrol and diesel used for car travel are estimated using emission factors sourced from the Ministry of Environment.

We estimate how much petrol or diesel you use based on your purchases over the last week or month. If you don't know how many litres of petrol or diesel you use we estimate this based on dollar amount and price per litre. We estimate the price per litre using information from the Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment.
